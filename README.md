### Specs

- [ ] Use at least 1 API
- [ ] Make your API calls from the back-end using the request module
- [ ] Your server should contain a minimum of 2 routes
- [ ] Back-end testing using tape (test as many components as you can) and basic front-end testing.
- [ ] Test your server by injecting fake HTTP requests using Shot.
- [ ] Host your project on heroku, see resources
- [ ] Use module.exports and require to break a single large server file into smaller modules.
- [ ] Consider a good server file structure based on what we have discussed over the week.
- [ ] Employ continuous intergration on your project with Travis or a similar tool.
- [ ] Use CodeCov or a similar tool for test coverage.
- [ ] Display continuous integration and code coverage badges on your project README.
- [ ] Ensure that errors are handled, if for example a user attempts to make a request to a non-existent route to your server, provide the user with a custom response.


### Stretch goals

- [ ] I want to be able to choose a date and see obituaries from that day on previous years.
